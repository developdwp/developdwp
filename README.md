## Getting started

![Tutorial][tutorial]

```sh
z foo              # cd into highest ranked directory matching foo
z foo bar          # cd into highest ranked directory matching foo and bar

z ~/foo            # z also works like a regular cd command
z foo/             # cd into relative path
z ..               # cd one level up
z -                # cd into previous directory

zi foo             # cd with interactive selection (using fzf)

z foo<SPACE><TAB>  # show interactive completions (zoxide v0.7.10+, bash/fish/zsh only)
